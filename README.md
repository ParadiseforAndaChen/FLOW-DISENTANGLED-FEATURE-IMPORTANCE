We use three real-world open-source datasets in our experiments: **Pima Indians Diabetes**, **Cardiotocography (CTG)**, and **MicroMass**. All of them are publicly available and can be downloaded from the following links:  

- [Pima Indians Diabetes](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)  
- [Cardiotocography (CTG)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/193/cardiotocography)
